# Beyond Linear Regression: Exploring Polynomial and Ridge Regression

## Project Overview

This Jupyter notebook project introduces students to advanced regression techniques, focusing on polynomial regression and ridge regression. The project guides students through implementing these algorithms from scratch, comparing them with scikit-learn implementations, and applying them to real-world datasets.

## Learning Objectives

After completing this project, students will be able to:

1. Understand the mathematical foundations of polynomial and ridge regression
2. Implement regression algorithms from scratch using NumPy
3. Apply regularization techniques to prevent overfitting
4. Evaluate and compare regression models using appropriate metrics
5. Apply advanced regression techniques to real-world data
6. Visualize and interpret regression results effectively

## How Students Will Work on This Project

### Project Structure

This project is designed to be completed over a 2-week period, with the following structure:

#### Week 1: Implementation and Understanding
- Students begin by reviewing the mathematical formulations of polynomial and ridge regression
- They implement both algorithms from scratch using the provided pseudocode and skeleton code
- Students compare their implementations with scikit-learn's built-in functions
- They experiment with different hyperparameters (polynomial degree, regularization strength)

#### Week 2: Application and Analysis
- Students select a real-world dataset (provided options or their own choice)
- They apply their regression implementations to the selected dataset
- Students analyze and compare model performance
- They create visualizations to interpret their results
- Students complete a written report discussing their findings
